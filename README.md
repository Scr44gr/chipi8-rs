There's still a lot to do, but I think it's a good start 😊.

``cargo run`` 

By default I have let the cpu run at 20 cycles per frame, I think it's fine although in some games it feels too fast.

🍳 In the kitchen I am preparing a better UI to debug the whole VM, that's why I have left some enum states in the code. 🤠
